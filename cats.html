		<p>
		Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region
		and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United
		States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and
		diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are
		generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member
		regardless of breed.
		</p>
		<h2 id="zero-to-four-weeks">Zero to Four Weeks</h2>
		<p>
		It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is
		either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor
		your kitten's growth closely to make sure its growth rate is progressing
		steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker
		might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding
		tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include
		the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk
			</li>
			<li>
				Gastrointestinal disease
			</li>
			<li>
				Environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary
				conditions
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="four-weeks-to-one-year">Four Weeks to One Year</h2>
		<p>
		Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically
		around three to four weeks after birth. According to the 
		<a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips"
			 target="_blank">ASPCA</a>, kittens at this age should eat half to one
		 cup of dry kitten food or six to nine
		 ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating
		 hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat
		 food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that
		 are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your
		 cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always consult
		 with your veterinarian for recommendations.
		</p>
		<h2 id="one-to-seven-years">One Year to Seven Years</h2>
		<p>
		This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many
		nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does
		their metabolism. It is <em>not</em> recommended to leave food out for the
		cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals
		rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of
		obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.
		</p>
		<h2 id="seven-years-or-more">Seven Years and More</h2>
		<p>
		Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and
		experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats and
		calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing
		packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular
		protein (such as "salmon") and <em>not</em> just a category (such as
		fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser
		quality proteins.
